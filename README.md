# Gatsby Boilerplate Blog App 
This boilerplate blog is powered by Gatsby, Netlify, React Hooks, the Context API, GraphQL, and styled components.  I made this for fun to learn about Gatsby.

Deployed using netlify âœ¨ feel free to:
- Try out light and dark mode (created using the context API)
- Check out the cute mobile menu by shrinking your window
- Click on a mock blog post, paginate through the blog posts, and check out the mock about page
- Enjoy!
